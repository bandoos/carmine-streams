# carmine-streams

Utility functions for working with Redis streams in [carmine](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine).

## Usage

Create a consumer group:

```clj
(require '[carmine-streams.core :as cs])

(def conn-opts {})

(cs/create-consumer-group! conn-opts "my-stream" "my-group")
```

Create consumers:

```clj
(future
 (cs/start-consumer! conn-opts "my-stream" "my-group"
                     #(println "Yum yum, tasty message" %)
                     "my-consumer-0"))
```

Stop consumers:

```clj
(cs/stop-consumers! conn-opts "my-stream" "my-consumer-*")
```
